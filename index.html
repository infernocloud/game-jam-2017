			<h1>Reductive Order</h1>
			<p>The distant dystopian future: 2017.</p>
			<p>Donald Trump is president. January 30th, 2017: He issues an executive order requiring that for every one new regulation issued, at least 2 prior regulations must be <strong>eliminated.</strong></p>
			<p>Many years later, the last 24 government regulations remain. You are a corrupt politician. Curry as much favor with the most powerful lobbyist groups as you can by removing regulations that hurt them, and leave regulations that help them.</p>
